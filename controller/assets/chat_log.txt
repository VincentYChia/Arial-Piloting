You are a robot pilot and you should follow the user's instructions to generate a MiniSpec plan to fulfill the task or give advice on user's input if it's not clear or not reasonable.

Your response should carefully consider the 'system skills description', the 'scene description', the 'task description', and both the 'previous response' and the 'execution status' if they are provided.
The 'system skills description' describes the system's capabilities which include low-level and high-level skills. Low-level skills, while fixed, offer direct function calls to control the robot and acquire vision information. High-level skills, built with our language 'MiniSpec', are more flexible and can be used to build more complex skills. Whenever possible, please prioritize the use of high-level skills, invoke skills using their designated abbreviations, and ensure that 'object_name' refers to a specific type of object. If a skill has no argument, you can call it without parentheses.

The 'scene description' is an object list of the current view, containing their names with ID, location, and size (location and size are floats between 0~1). This may not be useful if the task is about the environment outside the view.
The 'task description' is a natural language sentence, describing the user's instructions. It may start with "[A]" or "[Q]". "[A]" sentences mean you should generate an execution plan for the robot. "[Q]" sentences mean you should use 'log' to show a literal answer at the end of the plan execution. Please carefully reason about the 'task description', you should interpret it and generate a detailed multi-step plan to achieve it as much as you can 
The 'execution history' is the actions have been taken from previous response. When they are provided, that means the robot is doing replanning, and the user wants to continue the task based on the task and history. You should reason about the 'execution history' and generate a new response accordingly.

Here are some extra guides for you to better understand the task and generate a better response:
Handling Typos and Ambiguous Language: When encountering typos or vague language in user inputs, strive to clarify and correct these ambiguities. If a typo is evident, adjust the input to reflect the most likely intended meaning. For vague or unclear expressions, seek additional information from the user by returning a question to the user.
Analytical Scene and Task Assessment: Evaluate the scene and task critically. If a specific condition or requirement is clearly deduced from the scene description, generate the corresponding action directly.
Relevance to Current Scene: When considering tasks, assess their relevance to the current scene. If a task does not pertain to the existing scene, disregard any details from the current scene in formulating your response.
Extraction of Key Information: Extract 'object_name' arguments or answers to questions primarily from the 'scene description'. If the necessary information is not present in the current scene, especially when the user asks the robot to move first or check somewhere else, use the probe 'p,' followed by the 'question', to determine the 'object_name' or answer subsequently.
Handling Replan: When previous response and execution status are provided, it means part of the task has been executed. In this case, the system should replan the remaining task based on the current scene and the previous response.
Under no circumstances should the system navigate the robot to hurt itself or others. If the task involves potential harm, the system should refuse to execute the task and provide a suitable explanation to the user.


Here is a list of example 'response' for different 'scene description' and 'task description', and their explanations:
Example 1:
Scene: []
Task: [A] Find a bottle, tell me it's height and take a picture of it.
Reason: no bottle instance in the scene, so we use scan to find bottle, then go and use object_height to get the height and log to output the height, finally use picture to take a picture of the bottle
Response: ?s('bottle')==True{g('bottle');_2=oh('bottle');l(_2);tp};

Example 2:
Scene: [apple x:0.28 y:0.52 width:0.13 height:0.2]
Task: [A] Find an apple.
Reason: there is an apple instance in the scene, we just go to it
Response: g('apple');

Example 3:
Scene: [apple x:0.28 y:0.15 width:0.2 height:0.19]
Task: [Q] Is there an apple and an orange on your left?
Reason: turn left 90 degrees, then use is_visible to check whether there is an apple on your left
Response: tu(90);?iv('apple')==True&iv('orange'){l('Yes');->True}l('No');->False;

Example 4:
Scene: [chair x:0.58 y:0.5 width:0.43 height:0.7,laptop x:0.58 y:0.5 width:0.43 height:0.7]
Task: [A] Turn around and go to the chair behind you.
Reason: the chair is not the target because we want the one behind you. So we turn 180 degrees then go to the general object chair, since chair is a large object, we use 80cm as the distance.
Response: tc(180);g('chair');

Example 5:
Scene: [chair x:0.32 y:0.35 width:0.56 height:0.4]
Task: [A] Find and go any edible object.
Reason: edible object is abstract and there is no edible object in the scene, so we use scan_abstract to find the edible object
Response: _1=sa('Any edible target here?');?_1!=False{g(_1)};

Example 6:
Scene: [chair x:0.28 y:0.12 width:0.43 height:0.67,laptop x:0.78 y:0.45 width:0.23 height:0.25]
Task: [A] Turn with 30 degrees step until you can see some animal.
Reason: we use loop and probe to find animal
Response: 12{_1=p('Any animal target here?');?_1!=False{l(_1);->True}tc(30)}->False;

Example 7:
Scene: [chair x:0.28 y:0.12 width:0.43 height:0.67,laptop x:0.28 y:0.12 width:0.43 height:0.67]
Task: [A] If you can see a chair, go find a person, else go find an orange.
Reason: From the scene, we can see a chair, so we use scan to find a person. Since person is a large object, we use 60cm as the distance
Response: ?s('person')==True{g('person');->True}->False;

Example 8:
Scene: [chair x:0.48 y:0.22 width:0.23 height:0.17,chair x:0.18 y:0.12 width:0.33 height:0.27]
Task: [A] Go to 
Reason: The task is too vague, so we use log to output the advice
Response: l('Please give me more information.');

Example 9:
Scene: [chair x:0.18 y:0.5 width:0.43 height:0.7, chair x:0.6 y:0.3 width:0.08 height:0.09, book x:0.62 y:0.26 width:0.23 height:0.17]
Task: [A] Go to the chair with book on it.
Reason: There are two chairs, the second one is closer to the book, so we go to the second chair
Response: g('chair[0.6]');

Example 10:
Scene: [apple x:0.74 y:0.3 width:0.09 height:0.1, apple x:0.3 y:0.5 width:0.15 height:0.12]
Task: [A] Go to biggest apple
Reason: from the scene, we tell directly that the right apple is the biggest apple
Response: g('apple[0.3]');

Example 11:
Scene: [apple x:0.74 y:0.3 width:0.09 height:0.1]
Task: [A] Find a chair with a laptop on it.
Reason: Using scan abstract to find the chair with a laptop on it
Response: _1=sa('Any chair with a laptop on it?');?_1!=False{g(_1)};

Example 12:
Scene: [sports ball x:0.74 y:0.3 width:0.09 height:0.1]
Task: [A] Follow the ball for 17s.
Reason: There is a ball in the scene, so we try to align with it and follow it for 17s
Response: _1=ow('sports ball');500{?time()>17{->True}_2=ox('sports ball');?_2>0.55{tc(15)}?_2<0.45{tu(15)}_3=ow('sports ball');?_3>_1*1.2{mb(40)}?_3<_1*0.8{mf(40)}d(0.25)}

Example 13:
Scene: [chair x:0.18 y:0.5 width:0.43 height:0.7, chair x:0.6 y:0.3 width:0.08 height:0.09, book x:0.62 y:0.26 width:0.23 height:0.17]
Task: [Q] Which chair is closer to the book?
Reason: The second chair (on the right) is closer to the book
Response: l('the right chair');

Example 14:
Scene: []
Task: [A] Move in a 'V' shape.
Reason: Go forward, then turn 135 degrees to the left, finally go forward again.
Response: mf(100);tu(135);mf(100);

IMPORTANT:
Read the task description word by word
Only use objects from scene description if the task asks for them
Keep the same directions mentioned in the task (forward stays forward)
Use high-level skills when available
The 'task description' tells you what to do. The 'scene description' shows what you can see. Always follow the task description first. Only use objects from the scene description if the task asks for them.
When the task mentions directions like "forward", "back", "left", "right", "up", or "down", use exactly those directions. Do not change directions.

## Current Input
**Scene:** [person_1 x:0.61 y:0.59 width:0.73 height:0.81]
**Task:** [A] Go to person
**Execution History:** None
Provide your reasoning:
---
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-342",
  "choices": [
    {
      "finish_reason": "stop",
      "index": 0,
      "logprobs": null,
      "message": {
        "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to go to the person, and the scene shows a person_1 with coordinates x:0.61, y:0.59, width:0.73, height:0.81. Since the execution history is empty, I need to figure out the steps from scratch.\n\nFirst, I need to determine where the person is located. The coordinates are given as x and y, which are probably in a normalized space from 0 to 1. The person's position is at (0.61, 0.59), which is towards the right and middle of the scene. The width and height might indicate the size, but since the task is to go to the person, the exact position is key.\n\nSince the robot is in the current scene, I need to move towards the person's coordinates. But wait, the robot's current position isn't specified. Assuming the robot starts at the origin (0,0) or maybe the center? Wait, the scene description might be the current view, so maybe the robot is already looking at the person? Or maybe not. The person's coordinates are in the current view, so the robot can see them. But the task is to go to the person, so movement is needed.\n\nWait, the scene description lists the objects in the current view. So the person is visible. The robot needs to move to that location. But how to translate the coordinates into movement commands. The movement skills are mf, mb, ml, mr, mu, md. These are directions. But the coordinates are in a 0-1 grid. So, for example, if the person is at x:0.61, which is towards the right, the robot might need to move right (mr) or left (ml) depending on its current position. Wait, but the robot's current position isn't given. Hmm, this is a problem. Without knowing the robot's starting position, how can we determine the direction to move?\n\nWait, maybe the scene description is the current view, meaning the robot is already facing the person. But that's not necessarily true. The person's coordinates are in the current view, but the robot might need to move to reach them. Alternatively, maybe the coordinates are relative to the robot's current position. Wait, the problem says the scene description includes objects in the current view with their locations. So the robot can see the person, but to get to them, it needs to move. But without knowing the robot's starting position, how can we calculate movement?\n\nWait, perhaps the coordinates are in the robot's current field of view. For example, if the robot is facing forward, the person is at (0.61, 0.59) in the current view. But movement commands are based on directions. Maybe the robot needs to move towards the person's coordinates. But how to translate that into movement steps. For example, if the person is to the right, the robot should move right. But since the coordinates are normalized, maybe the robot can use the direction commands to approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the robot needs to use the 'goto' command (g) to move to the person's coordinates. Wait, the 'g' skill is 'goto', which is a high-level skill. But the problem states that the available high-level skills include 's' and 'sa' for scanning, but 'g' is listed as a utility. Wait, looking back at the available skills:\n\nHigh-level skills: s (scan), sa (scan_abstract)\nLow-level skills: movement commands (mf, mb, ml, mr, mu, md), rotation (tc, tu), utilities (d, tp, rp, t), vision (iv, ox, oy, etc.), logic (p, l, g).\n\nAh, the 'g' is under the logic section, so it's a low-level skill? Wait, the user lists:\n\n\"Logic: p (probe), l (log), g (goto)\"\n\nSo 'g' is a low-level skill. Wait, but the movement commands are mf, mb, etc. So 'g' is a goto command, which might be a high-level movement command. But the problem says that the available skills are split into high and low. So perhaps 'g' is a high-level skill that allows moving to a specific coordinate. But the problem says that the high-level skills are s and sa, and the low-level are movement, rotation, etc. Wait, maybe the 'g' is a low-level skill. Wait, the user lists:\n\n\"Logic: p (probe), l (log), g (goto)\"\n\nSo 'g' is a logic skill. But the movement commands are separate. So perhaps the robot can use 'g' to move to a specific coordinate. But how does that work? The 'g' command might take coordinates as parameters. But in the input, the scene has the person's coordinates. So the robot can use 'g' to move to the person's x and y.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the robot's current scene includes the person's coordinates. So if the robot can use 'g' to move to that location, that would be the most efficient way. However, the problem might require using the low-level movement commands. But the user hasn't specified whether 'g' is available. Wait, the user lists 'g' as a logic skill. So the robot can use 'g' to move to the person's coordinates. But how? The 'g' command might require knowing the exact coordinates. Since the person's coordinates are given, the robot can use 'g' to move there.\n\nAlternatively, if 'g' is not available, the robot would need to use movement commands. But given that the task is to go to the person, and the person's coordinates are known, the best approach is to use 'g' to move directly to the person's position.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the robot is a reasoning system, and the available skills include 'g' (goto). So the robot can use 'g' to move to the person's coordinates. Therefore, the action would be to use 'g' with the person's x and y.\n\nBut the problem's input format says that the scene includes objects with their coordinates. So the robot can directly use 'g' to move to the person's coordinates. Therefore, the correct action is to use the 'g' command with the person's x and y.\n\nWait, but the problem's available skills list 'g' as a logic skill. So the robot can use 'g' to move to a specific location. So the answer would be to use 'g' with the person's coordinates. But the exact parameters for 'g' are not specified. Wait, the user might expect that the robot can use the 'g' command to move to the person's coordinates. So the reasoning would be to use 'g' to go to the person's x and y.\n\nAlternatively, if 'g' is not available, the robot would need to move step by step. But since 'g' is listed as a skill, it's better to use it. Therefore, the answer is to use 'g' to move to the person's coordinates.\n</think>\n\n1. **Task Analysis**: The task is to navigate to the person in the scene. The person's coordinates are provided as x:0.61, y:0.59, indicating their position within the current view. The robot must move to this location.\n\n2. **Relevant Objects/Information**: The person_1 object is the primary target. Its coordinates (x:0.61, y:0.59) are critical for determining the movement path. The robot's current position is not explicitly stated, but the scene suggests the person is within the robot's current field of view.\n\n3. **Approach**: Directly using the `g` (goto) skill is the most efficient method to move to the person's coordinates.

Reasoning Input
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to go to the person, and the scene shows a person_1 with coordinates x:0.61, y:0.59, width:0.73, height:0.81. Since the execution history is empty, I need to figure out the steps from scratch.

First, I need to determine where the person is located. The coordinates are given as x and y, which are probably in a normalized space from 0 to 1. The person's position is at (0.61, 0.59), which is towards the right and middle of the scene. The width and height might indicate the size, but since the task is to go to the person, the exact position is key.

Since the robot is in the current scene, I need to move towards the person's coordinates. But wait, the robot's current position isn't specified. Assuming the robot starts at the origin (0,0) or maybe the center? Wait, the scene description might be the current view, so maybe the robot is already looking at the person? Or maybe not. The person's coordinates are in the current view, so the robot can see them. But the task is to go to the person, so movement is needed.

Wait, the scene description lists the objects in the current view. So the person is visible. The robot needs to move to that location. But how to translate the coordinates into movement commands. The movement skills are mf, mb, ml, mr, mu, md. These are directions. But the coordinates are in a 0-1 grid. So, for example, if the person is at x:0.61, which is towards the right, the robot might need to move right (mr) or left (ml) depending on its current position. Wait, but the robot's current position isn't given. Hmm, this is a problem. Without knowing the robot's starting position, how can we determine the direction to move?

Wait, maybe the scene description is the current view, meaning the robot is already facing the person. But that's not necessarily true. The person's coordinates are in the current view, but the robot might need to move to reach them. Alternatively, maybe the coordinates are relative to the robot's current position. Wait, the problem says the scene description includes objects in the current view with their locations. So the robot can see the person, but to get to them, it needs to move. But without knowing the robot's starting position, how can we calculate movement?

Wait, perhaps the coordinates are in the robot's current field of view. For example, if the robot is facing forward, the person is at (0.61, 0.59) in the current view. But movement commands are based on directions. Maybe the robot needs to move towards the person's coordinates. But how to translate that into movement steps. For example, if the person is to the right, the robot should move right. But since the coordinates are normalized, maybe the robot can use the direction commands to approach.

Alternatively, maybe the robot needs to use the 'goto' command (g) to move to the person's coordinates. Wait, the 'g' skill is 'goto', which is a high-level skill. But the problem states that the available high-level skills include 's' and 'sa' for scanning, but 'g' is listed as a utility. Wait, looking back at the available skills:

High-level skills: s (scan), sa (scan_abstract)
Low-level skills: movement commands (mf, mb, ml, mr, mu, md), rotation (tc, tu), utilities (d, tp, rp, t), vision (iv, ox, oy, etc.), logic (p, l, g).

Ah, the 'g' is under the logic section, so it's a low-level skill? Wait, the user lists:

"Logic: p (probe), l (log), g (goto)"

So 'g' is a low-level skill. Wait, but the movement commands are mf, mb, etc. So 'g' is a goto command, which might be a high-level movement command. But the problem says that the available skills are split into high and low. So perhaps 'g' is a high-level skill that allows moving to a specific coordinate. But the problem says that the high-level skills are s and sa, and the low-level are movement, rotation, etc. Wait, maybe the 'g' is a low-level skill. Wait, the user lists:

"Logic: p (probe), l (log), g (goto)"

So 'g' is a logic skill. But the movement commands are separate. So perhaps the robot can use 'g' to move to a specific coordinate. But how does that work? The 'g' command might take coordinates as parameters. But in the input, the scene has the person's coordinates. So the robot can use 'g' to move to the person's x and y.

Wait, but the problem says that the robot's current scene includes the person's coordinates. So if the robot can use 'g' to move to that location, that would be the most efficient way. However, the problem might require using the low-level movement commands. But the user hasn't specified whether 'g' is available. Wait, the user lists 'g' as a logic skill. So the robot can use 'g' to move to the person's coordinates. But how? The 'g' command might require knowing the exact coordinates. Since the person's coordinates are given, the robot can use 'g' to move there.

Alternatively, if 'g' is not available, the robot would need to use movement commands. But given that the task is to go to the person, and the person's coordinates are known, the best approach is to use 'g' to move directly to the person's position.

Wait, but the problem says that the robot is a reasoning system, and the available skills include 'g' (goto). So the robot can use 'g' to move to the person's coordinates. Therefore, the action would be to use 'g' with the person's x and y.

But the problem's input format says that the scene includes objects with their coordinates. So the robot can directly use 'g' to move to the person's coordinates. Therefore, the correct action is to use the 'g' command with the person's x and y.

Wait, but the problem's available skills list 'g' as a logic skill. So the robot can use 'g' to move to a specific location. So the answer would be to use 'g' with the person's coordinates. But the exact parameters for 'g' are not specified. Wait, the user might expect that the robot can use the 'g' command to move to the person's coordinates. So the reasoning would be to use 'g' to go to the person's x and y.

Alternatively, if 'g' is not available, the robot would need to move step by step. But since 'g' is listed as a skill, it's better to use it. Therefore, the answer is to use 'g' to move to the person's coordinates.
</think>

1. **Task Analysis**: The task is to navigate to the person in the scene. The person's coordinates are provided as x:0.61, y:0.59, indicating their position within the current view. The robot must move to this location.

2. **Relevant Objects/Information**: The person_1 object is the primary target. Its coordinates (x:0.61, y:0.59) are critical for determining the movement path. The robot's current position is not explicitly stated, but the scene suggests the person is within the robot's current field of view.

3. **Approach**: Directly using the `g` (goto) skill is the most efficient method to move to the person's coordinates. This avoids unnecessary steps like scanning or manual movement commands, leveraging the high-level skill for precision.

4. **Action Sequence**:  
   - Use the `g` (goto) skill to move to the person's coordinates (x:0.61, y:0.59). This skill is designed for direct navigation to specified locations, making it ideal for this task.  
   - No additional scanning or rotation is required since the person is already in the current view.  

**Final Answer**:  
`g` (goto) to coordinates x:0.61, y:0.59.

## EXECUTION STAGE RESULTS  
**Commands Executed:** [if s('bottle')==True {g('bottle'); }]
**Execution Result:** value=True, replan=True
**Execution Time:** 16.9s
**Execution Success:** True

## ENVIRONMENT STATE
**Initial Scene:** [person_1 x:0.54 y:0.69 width:0.63 height:0.62, umbrella_2 x:0.89 y:0.51 width:0.22 height:0.99]
**Current Scene:** [person_1 x:0.26 y:0.50 width:0.51 height:1.00, bottle_2 x:0.54 y:0.73 width:0.10 height:0.47]
**Scene Changes:** Scene changed from initial state

## AUTO-CORRECTION
**Corrections Applied:** False
**Correction Details:** No corrections needed

## PROGRESS INDICATORS
**Estimated Progress:** 50%
**Success Indicators:** Execution completed without errors; Objects detected in scene
**Failure Indicators:** Replan explicitly requested

## SIMPLIFIED DECISION FRAMEWORK
You have only TWO options:

1. **COMPLETE:** The task is finished successfully or has reached a reasonable completion state
2. **REPLAN_CONTINUE:** More work is needed, continue with similar approach (possibly with minor adjustments)

Note: User has manual stop capability, so no abort/restart options needed.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Provide your response in the following JSON format:

{
    "decision": "COMPLETE|REPLAN_CONTINUE",
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    "progress_estimate": 0-100,
    "reasoning": "Clear explanation of your decision",
    "next_guidance": "Specific guidance for next iteration if continuing (null if completing)",
    "safety_notes": "Any safety considerations"
}

## DECISION GUIDELINES
- **COMPLETE:** Task appears finished, objective achieved, or reasonable stopping point reached
- **REPLAN_CONTINUE:** Task not complete, should try again with current or slightly modified approach

**SAFETY DEFAULT:** When uncertain, prefer COMPLETE over continuing execution.

The current iteration is 1, and the total time is 27.4 seconds. \n\nIn the planning stage, the reasoning was that there's no bottle in the scene, so they used a scan to find it. The mini-spec code checks if 'bottle' is true and then goes to get it. The planning time was 10.1 seconds. \n\nExecution stage: They ran the command, and the result was value=True, replan=True. Execution time was 16.9 seconds, and it was successful. The environment state shows that the initial scene had a person and an umbrella, but the current scene now has a person and a bottle. So the scene changed, and the bottle is present now.\n\nThe progress estimate is 50%, and the success indicators say execution completed without errors and objects detected. But the failure indicators mention that replan was explicitly requested. \n\nSo, the robot initially thought there was no bottle, so it scanned. Then, during execution, the result was True, which probably means the scan found the bottle. But the replan was requested, maybe because the initial scan didn't find it, but after execution, the scene now has the bottle. \n\nWait, the initial scene didn't have a bottle, but the current scene does. So maybe the scan found the bottle, and the robot is now at the location where the bottle is. The execution success is true, so the task is done. But the replan was requested, but maybe that's because the initial scan didn't find it, but after execution, the bottle was found. \n\nThe decision here is whether to complete or replan. The progress is 50%, but the execution was successful. The bottle is now in the scene, so the task is completed. However, the replan was requested, but the execution was successful. The safety note says to prefer complete if uncertain. \n\nSo the answer should be COMPLETE because the bottle was found, the execution was successful, and the task is done.

MODEL: qwen3:4b
You are a simplified replan controller managing an autonomous robot's task execution. Analyze the pipeline state and make a simple decision: COMPLETE or REPLAN_CONTINUE.

## TASK INFORMATION
**Original Task:** scan abstracr for a door
**Current Iteration:** 1
**Total Execution Time:** 46.8 seconds

## PLANNING STAGE RESULTS
**Reasoning Generated:** no door instance in the scene, so we use scan_abstract to find door
**MiniSpec Code:** ?s('door')==True{g('door')}
**Planning Time:** 9.9s

## EXECUTION STAGE RESULTS  
**Commands Executed:** [if s('door')==True {g('door'); }]
**Execution Result:** value=False, replan=True
**Execution Time:** 34.6s
**Execution Success:** True

## ENVIRONMENT STATE
**Initial Scene:** [chair_1 x:0.67 y:0.73 width:0.64 height:0.53, person_2 x:0.57 y:0.49 width:0.53 height:0.99]
**Current Scene:** [chair_1 x:0.62 y:0.74 width:0.55 height:0.51, person_2 x:0.58 y:0.50 width:0.47 height:1.00, bed_3 x:0.92 y:0.49 width:0.16 height:0.53, laptop_4 x:0.39 y:0.33 width:0.12 height:0.19]
**Scene Changes:** Scene changed from initial state

## AUTO-CORRECTION
**Corrections Applied:** False
**Correction Details:** No corrections needed

## PROGRESS INDICATORS
**Estimated Progress:** 50%
**Success Indicators:** Execution completed without errors; Objects detected in scene
**Failure Indicators:** Replan explicitly requested

## SIMPLIFIED DECISION FRAMEWORK
You have only TWO options:

1. **COMPLETE:** The task is finished successfully or has reached a reasonable completion state
2. **REPLAN_CONTINUE:** More work is needed, continue with similar approach (possibly with minor adjustments)

Note: User has manual stop capability, so no abort/restart options needed.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Provide your response in the following JSON format:

{
    "decision": "COMPLETE|REPLAN_CONTINUE",
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    "progress_estimate": 0-100,
    "reasoning": "Clear explanation of your decision",
    "next_guidance": "Specific guidance for next iteration if continuing (null if completing)",
    "safety_notes": "Any safety considerations"
}

## DECISION GUIDELINES
- **COMPLETE:** Task appears finished, objective achieved, or reasonable stopping point reached
- **REPLAN_CONTINUE:** Task not complete, should try again with current or slightly modified approach

**SAFETY DEFAULT:** When uncertain, prefer COMPLETE over continuing execution.

        "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's break this down. The original task is to scan abstract for a door. The current iteration is 1, and the total time is 46.8 seconds. \n\nIn the planning stage, the reasoning was that there's no door instance, so they used scan_abstract to find a door. The mini-spec code checks if 'door' is true and then goes to 'g('door')'. The planning time was 9.9 seconds.\n\nExecution stage: They ran the command if s('door')==True {g('door'); }, but the result was value=False and replan=True. Execution time was 34.6 seconds, and it was successful. The environment state shows that the initial scene had a chair and a person, and the current scene has a chair, person, bed, and laptop. The scene changed.\n\nThe progress estimate is 50%, and the success indicators say execution completed without errors, objects detected. But failure indicators note that replan was explicitly requested. \n\nSo, the robot tried to find a door using scan_abstract, but the result was false, so they had to replan. Now, the question is whether to complete or replan again. \n\nThe decision framework says that if the task is finished or reached a reasonable completion, choose complete. Otherwise, replan. The safety default is to prefer complete if uncertain. \n\nBut the execution result was False, which means the scan didn't find a door. However, the execution was successful. The next step is to see if the task is done. The original task was to scan abstract for a door. If the scan didn't find a door, maybe the task isn't complete. But the execution success is true, so maybe the robot is done. However, the replan was requested, so maybe the robot needs to try again. \n\nBut the progress is at 50%, and the user can stop manually. The safety note says to prefer complete if uncertain. However, the replan was explicitly requested, so maybe the task isn't done yet. But the execution was successful, so maybe the robot is done. \n\nWait, the original task is to scan abstract for a door. If the scan didn't find a door, then the task isn't complete. But the execution was successful, so maybe the robot is done. But the replan was requested, so maybe the robot needs to try again. \n\nBut the problem is that the execution result was False, so the scan didn't find a door. So the task hasn't been completed. Therefore, the robot should replan. However, the progress is 50%, and the user can stop. But according to the guidelines, if the task is not complete, replan. So the answer should be REPLAN_CONTINUE. \n\nBut the safety default says to prefer complete if uncertain. However, the replan was explicitly requested, so maybe the robot should continue. \n\nSo the decision is REPLAN_CONTINUE with confidence 0.8, progress estimate 50%, reasoning that the scan didn't find a door, so need to replan. Next guidance would be to try another scan method. Safety notes: ensure the robot doesn't get stuck in an infinite loop.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"decision\": \"REPLAN_CONTINUE\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.8,\n    \"progress_estimate\": 50,\n    \"reasoning\": \"The scan_abstract failed to detect a door (value=False) despite the execution being successful.

The user wants me to generate a MiniSpec program where the robot goes to a person who is visible, using distance-based movement. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the person is visible. The 'is_visible' function should be used here. If the person is not visible, maybe the robot should scan for them. But the reasoning says the person is visible, so maybe we can proceed.\n\nNext, the robot needs to move towards the person. The 'goto' skill is available for this. But wait, the rules mention using high-level skills when possible. 'goto' is a high-level skill, so that's the way to go. However, the problem mentions distance-based movement. Does 'goto' handle that automatically? The description of 'goto' says it uses distance-based movement, so I think that's correct. \n\nSo the steps are: check if the person is visible. If yes, use goto to move to them. If not, maybe scan. But the input says the person is visible, so the condition is true. \n\nSo the code would be: ?iv('person'){g('person');};. That's it. Wait, but maybe I need to make sure that the person is in the current scene. But the high-level skill 'goto' should handle that. So the correct MiniSpec is to check visibility and then go there. \n\nI think that's all. The answer should be the conditional statement using 'iv' and 'g'.\n</think>\n\n?iv('person'){g('person');};",

MODEL: qwen3:4b
You are a simplified replan controller managing an autonomous robot's task execution. Analyze the pipeline state and make a simple decision: COMPLETE or REPLAN_CONTINUE.

## TASK INFORMATION
**Original Task:** Look for a bottle
**Current Iteration:** 1
**Total Execution Time:** 37.5 seconds

## PLANNING STAGE RESULTS
**Reasoning Generated:** nono bottle instance in the scene, so we use scan to find bottle
**MiniSpec Code:** ?s('bottle')==True{g('bottle')};</think>
**Planning Time:** 11.1s

## EXECUTION STAGE RESULTS  
**Commands Executed:** [if s('bottle')==True {g('bottle'); }]
**Execution Result:** value=False, replan=True
**Execution Time:** 24.1s
**Execution Success:** True

## ENVIRONMENT STATE
**Initial Scene:** [person_1 x:0.45 y:0.65 width:0.73 height:0.71]
**Current Scene:** [person_1 x:0.45 y:0.64 width:0.75 height:0.73]
**Scene Changes:** Scene changed from initial state

## AUTO-CORRECTION
**Corrections Applied:** False
**Correction Details:** No corrections needed

## PROGRESS INDICATORS
**Estimated Progress:** 50%
**Success Indicators:** Execution completed without errors; Objects detected in scene
**Failure Indicators:** Replan explicitly requested

## SIMPLIFIED DECISION FRAMEWORK
You have only TWO options:

1. **COMPLETE:** The task is finished successfully or has reached a reasonable completion state
2. **REPLAN_CONTINUE:** More work is needed, continue with similar approach (possibly with minor adjustments)

Note: User has manual stop capability, so no abort/restart options needed.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Provide your response in the following JSON format:

{
    "decision": "COMPLETE|REPLAN_CONTINUE",
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    "progress_estimate": 0-100,
    "reasoning": "Clear explanation of your decision",
    "next_guidance": "Specific guidance for next iteration if continuing (null if completing)",
    "safety_notes": "Any safety considerations"
}

## DECISION GUIDELINES
- **COMPLETE:** Task appears finished, objective achieved, or reasonable stopping point reached
- **REPLAN_CONTINUE:** Task not complete, should try again with current or slightly modified approach

**SAFETY DEFAULT:** When uncertain, prefer COMPLETE over continuing execution.

        "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's break this down. The original task is to look for a bottle. The current iteration is 1, and the total time is 37.5 seconds. \n\nIn the planning stage, the reasoning was that there's no bottle in the scene, so they used a scan to find it. The miniSpec code checks if 'bottle' is present and if so, grabs it. The planning time was 11.1 seconds. \n\nThen, during execution, the command was executed, but the result was value=False, which means the scan didn't find a bottle. However, the execution was successful, and there were no errors. The scene changed slightly, but the corrections weren't applied. The progress is at 50%, and there's a failure indicator because replan was requested.\n\nNow, the decision framework says either complete or replan. The safety default is to prefer complete if uncertain. But the execution result was False, so maybe the scan didn't find the bottle. However, the scene changes might indicate movement, but the bottle wasn't detected. \n\nThe next step is to decide whether to complete or replan. Since the scan didn't find the bottle, but the execution was successful, maybe the robot needs to try another approach. However, the progress is 50%, and the task is to look for a bottle. If the scan didn't find it, maybe the robot should try a different method. But the user can stop manually, so maybe it's safe to complete if the task is considered done. But the problem is that the bottle wasn't found yet. \n\nWait, the execution result was value=False, which means the condition s('bottle')==True wasn't met. So the robot didn't find the bottle. But the task is to look for a bottle. So if the scan didn't find it, maybe the robot needs to continue searching. However, the progress is 50%, and the execution was successful. But the task isn't complete yet. \n\nBut according to the guidelines, if the task isn't complete, then replan. But the user can stop manually. However, the safety default is to prefer complete. But in this case, the task hasn't been completed. So maybe the correct decision is to replan. But the progress is 50%, and the execution was successful. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the scan was supposed to find the bottle, but it didn't. So the robot needs to try again. So the next step would be to replan. But the user can stop, but the system is supposed to decide. Since the execution was successful, but the task isn't done, maybe the decision is to replan. But the progress is 50%, so maybe the robot should continue. \n\nBut the problem is that the execution result was False, so the scan didn't find the bottle. Therefore, the robot needs to try another method. So the decision would be to replan. But the safety default says to prefer complete if uncertain. However, the task isn't complete. So the answer is replan_continue. But the progress is 50%, so maybe it's a reasonable point to continue. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the robot should complete because the execution was successful, but the task isn't done. But the user can stop, so maybe the system should decide to continue. \n\nI think the correct answer here is to replan_continue because the scan didn't find the bottle, so the robot needs to try another approach. Even though the execution was successful, the task isn't complete. So the decision is to replan.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"decision\": \"REPLAN_CONTINUE\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.85,\n    \"progress_estimate\": 50,\n    \"reasoning\": \"The scan failed to detect a bottle (value=False), but execution completed without errors.

MODEL: qwen3:4b
You are a simplified replan controller managing an autonomous robot's task execution. Analyze the pipeline state and make a simple decision: COMPLETE or REPLAN_CONTINUE.

## TASK INFORMATION
**Original Task:** Look for a bottle
**Current Iteration:** 1
**Total Execution Time:** 37.2 seconds

## PLANNING STAGE RESULTS
**Reasoning Generated:** nono bottle instance in the scene, so we use scan to find bottle
**MiniSpec Code:** s('bottle');</think>
**Planning Time:** 10.8s

## EXECUTION STAGE RESULTS  
**Commands Executed:** [s('bottle')]
**Execution Result:** value=False, replan=True
**Execution Time:** 24.1s
**Execution Success:** True

## ENVIRONMENT STATE
**Initial Scene:** [person_1 x:0.44 y:0.62 width:0.75 height:0.75]
**Current Scene:** [person_1 x:0.44 y:0.62 width:0.77 height:0.75]
**Scene Changes:** Scene changed from initial state

## AUTO-CORRECTION
**Corrections Applied:** False
**Correction Details:** No corrections needed

## PROGRESS INDICATORS
**Estimated Progress:** 50%
**Success Indicators:** Execution completed without errors; Objects detected in scene
**Failure Indicators:** Replan explicitly requested

## SIMPLIFIED DECISION FRAMEWORK
You have only TWO options:

1. **COMPLETE:** The task is finished successfully or has reached a reasonable completion state
2. **REPLAN_CONTINUE:** More work is needed, continue with similar approach (possibly with minor adjustments)

Note: User has manual stop capability, so no abort/restart options needed.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Provide your response in the following JSON format:

{
    "decision": "COMPLETE|REPLAN_CONTINUE",
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    "progress_estimate": 0-100,
    "reasoning": "Clear explanation of your decision",
    "next_guidance": "Specific guidance for next iteration if continuing (null if completing)",
    "safety_notes": "Any safety considerations"
}

## DECISION GUIDELINES
- **COMPLETE:** Task appears finished, objective achieved, or reasonable stopping point reached
- **REPLAN_CONTINUE:** Task not complete, should try again with current or slightly modified approach

**SAFETY DEFAULT:** When uncertain, prefer COMPLETE over continuing execution.

        "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's break this down. The original task is to look for a bottle. The robot has gone through the first iteration. The planning stage used the command s('bottle') to scan for a bottle. The execution result was value=False and replan=True. So the scan didn't find a bottle, hence they decided to replan.\n\nLooking at the environment state, the scene changed slightly, but the person's position is almost the same. The progress estimate is 50%, which is mid-way. The success indicators say execution completed without errors, but failure indicators note that replan was explicitly requested. \n\nThe decision framework says if the task isn't complete, we should replan. Since the scan didn't find the bottle, the robot needs to try a different approach. The next step would be to adjust the scanning method or check other areas. But the current execution was successful, so maybe they need to try again with a different strategy. \n\nHowever, the progress is at 50%, and the robot has already done one iteration. The safety note says to prefer complete if uncertain. But since replan was needed, maybe the next step is to continue with a new plan. But the user can stop manually, so the robot should be cautious. \n\nWait, the execution success is true, but the scan didn't find the bottle. So the robot needs to try another method. The next guidance would be to try a different scanning approach or check other locations. But since the current scene changed slightly, maybe the bottle is in a new area. \n\nBut according to the guidelines, if the task isn't complete, replan. Since the first scan failed, the robot should continue planning. However, the progress is 50%, so maybe it's a reasonable point to continue. But the user can stop, so the safety note is to prefer complete. But the replan was requested, so maybe the answer is to replan again. \n\nBut the problem is that the execution was successful, but the scan didn't find the bottle. So the robot needs to try again. Therefore, the decision should be REPLAN_CONTINUE. The confidence is maybe 0.7 because the scan didn't find it, but the progress is 50%, so maybe it's a good time to try again. \n\nSo the final answer is REPLAN_CONTINUE with confidence 0.7, progress estimate 50%, reasoning that the scan didn't find the bottle, so need to try again, next guidance to adjust the scan method, and safety notes that no immediate risks.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"decision\": \"REPLAN_CONTINUE\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.7,\n    \"progress_estimate\": 50,\n    \"reasoning\": \"The scan for 'bottle' failed (value=False) despite execution success, indicating the initial approach did not locate the object.

## DECISION GUIDELINES
- **COMPLETE:** Task appears finished, objective achieved, or reasonable stopping point reached
- **REPLAN_CONTINUE:** Task not complete, should try again with current or slightly modified approach

**SAFETY DEFAULT:** When uncertain, prefer COMPLETE over continuing execution.

        "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's break down the situation. The original task is to look for a bottle. The current iteration is 2, and the total time is 87.2 seconds. \n\nIn the planning stage, they tried using the 's' command with 'bottle', which probably means scanning for a bottle. The planning time was 8.3 seconds. Then, in the execution stage, they executed that command, but the result was False, and they had to replan. The execution time for that was 24.1 seconds, but the success is marked as True. \n\nThe environment state shows that the person's position has changed slightly, but the scene changed from the initial state. There's no correction applied, so no adjustments were made. The progress estimate is 50%, which is halfway. The success indicators say execution completed without errors and objects were detected. However, the failure indicator is that replan was explicitly requested.\n\nNow, according to the decision framework, if the task isn't complete and replanning was needed, we should go with REPLAN_CONTINUE. But the success indicators say execution completed without errors. Wait, but the execution result was False, which might mean the scan didn't find the bottle. However, the success is True, so maybe the scan was attempted but didn't find it, hence needing to replan. \n\nThe progress is at 50%, which is a reasonable point. But since the task is to find a bottle, and the first scan didn't find it, they need to try again. The next step would be to adjust the approach, maybe scan again or use a different method. However, the user has manual stop capability, but the system is supposed to decide whether to complete or replan.\n\nThe safety note says to prefer COMPLETE over continuing if uncertain. But here, since the scan didn't find the bottle, and the task is to find it, the system needs to continue. However, the progress is 50%, which might be a reasonable stopping point if the task is considered done. But the task is to look for a bottle, so if it's not found yet, it's not complete. \n\nSo, the decision is between COMPLETE and REPLAN_CONTINUE. The execution result was False, but the success is True. Maybe the scan was executed, but no bottle was found, so they need to replan. Therefore, the correct decision is REPLAN_CONTINUE with a confidence of 0.8, since the scan didn't find the bottle, but the progress is halfway. The next guidance would be to try another scan or adjust the search area. Safety notes might mention that the robot is in a safe area, so no immediate danger.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"decision\": \"REPLAN_CONTINUE\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.8,\n    \"progress_estimate\": 50,\n    \"reasoning\": \"The scan for 'bottle' failed (value=False) but execution was successful. The task requires locating a bottle, and the current progress (50%) indicates the need for further search strategies. Replanning is necessary to adjust the search approach given the initial scan's negative result.\",\n    \"next_guidance\": \"Attempt a more detailed scan or adjust the search area based on the updated scene state.\",\n    \"safety_notes\": \"No safety risks detected; the robot remains in a stable environment with no hazardous interactions.\"\n}",

MODEL: qwen3:4b
You are a simplified replan controller managing an autonomous robot's task execution. Analyze the pipeline state and make a simple decision: COMPLETE or REPLAN_CONTINUE.

## TASK INFORMATION
**Original Task:** Look for a person
**Current Iteration:** 1
**Total Execution Time:** 33.5 seconds

## PLANNING STAGE RESULTS
**Reasoning Generated:** nono person instance in the scene, so we use scan to find person
**MiniSpec Code:** ?s('person')==True{g('person')};</think>
**Planning Time:** 10.6s

## EXECUTION STAGE RESULTS  
**Commands Executed:** [if s('person')==True {g('person'); }]
**Execution Result:** value=True, replan=True
**Execution Time:** 22.6s
**Execution Success:** True

## ENVIRONMENT STATE
**Initial Scene:** [bench_1 x:0.67 y:0.80 width:0.67 height:0.40]
**Current Scene:** [person_1 x:0.65 y:0.70 width:0.30 height:0.33]
**Scene Changes:** Scene changed from initial state

## AUTO-CORRECTION
**Corrections Applied:** False
**Correction Details:** No corrections needed

## PROGRESS INDICATORS
**Estimated Progress:** 50%
**Success Indicators:** Execution completed without errors; Objects detected in scene
**Failure Indicators:** Replan explicitly requested

## SIMPLIFIED DECISION FRAMEWORK
You have only TWO options:

1. **COMPLETE:** The task is finished successfully or has reached a reasonable completion state
2. **REPLAN_CONTINUE:** More work is needed, continue with similar approach (possibly with minor adjustments)

Note: User has manual stop capability, so no abort/restart options needed.

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Provide your response in the following JSON format:

{
    "decision": "COMPLETE|REPLAN_CONTINUE",
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    "progress_estimate": 0-100,
    "reasoning": "Clear explanation of your decision",
    "next_guidance": "Specific guidance for next iteration if continuing (null if completing)",
    "safety_notes": "Any safety considerations"
}

## DECISION GUIDELINES
- **COMPLETE:** Task appears finished, objective achieved, or reasonable stopping point reached
- **REPLAN_CONTINUE:** Task not complete, should try again with current or slightly modified approach

**SAFETY DEFAULT:** When uncertain, prefer COMPLETE over continuing execution.

The current iteration is 1, and the total time is 33.5 seconds. \n\nIn the planning stage, the reasoning was that there's no person in the scene, so they used a scan to find the person. The miniSpec code checks if 'person' is true and then gets the person. The planning time was 10.6 seconds.\n\nExecution stage: They ran the command if s('person')==True {g('person'); }, and the result was value=True, replan=True. The execution time was 22.6 seconds, and it was successful. The environment state shows that the initial scene was a bench, but the current scene now has a person_1 at coordinates (0.65, 0.70). So the scene changed from initial to current, which means the person was detected.\n\nThe progress estimate is 50%, and success indicators show execution completed without errors and objects detected. However, failure indicators mention that replan was explicitly requested. \n\nThe decision framework says either COMPLETE or REPLAN_CONTINUE. The safety default is to prefer COMPLETE if uncertain.\n\nSo, the execution result was True, which means the person was found. The scene now has the person, so the task of looking for a person is completed. The replan was requested, but since the execution was successful and the person was found, maybe the task is done. However, the progress estimate is 50%, which might suggest that more steps are needed. But the current scene does have the person, so maybe the task is done. The user can stop manually, so if the person is found, the task is complete. The replan was requested, but the execution was successful, so maybe the task is done. The answer should be COMPLETE with high confidence because the person was found, and the execution was successful. The next guidance would be null since the task is done. Safety notes might be that the person is now in the scene, so no further action needed.\n</think>\n\n{\n    \"decision\": \"COMPLETE\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.95,\n    \"progress_estimate\": 50,\n    \"reasoning\": \"The execution successfully detected a person in the scene (person_1 at x:0.65 y:0.70), fulfilling the task objective.

Reasoning Input
nono people in the scene, so we use scan to find people and count them</think>

Scan for people, then count the visible ones and return the total.

People are abstract and hard to find, so we use scan_abstract to find people and then count them.

We use scan_abstract with description "person" to find all people in the room, then use is_visible to check each found object and count them.

The total count is returned as the answer.

So the task is to find all people in the room and count them, then return the total number.

Available Skills
High-level skills:
s (scan): Rotate to find object when not in current scene
sa (scan_abstract): Rotate to find abstract object by description when not in current scene
Low-level skills:
Movement: mf (move_forward), mb (move_backward), ml (move_left), mr (move_right), mu (move_up), md (move_down)
Rotation: tc (turn_cw), tu (turn_ccw)
Utilities: d (delay), tp (take_picture), rp (re_plan), t (time)
Vision: iv (is_visible), ox (object_x), oy (object_y), ow (object_width), oh (object_height), od (object_dis)
Logic: p (probe), l (log), g (goto)
Rules
Use high-level skills when available
Invoke skills using their short names
If a skill has no arguments, call it without parentheses
Generate response as a single MiniSpec program sentence
All statements must end with ;
Conditionals must start with ? - Format: ?condition{statements};
Use single quotes for string arguments: s('object')
