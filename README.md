# Arial-Piloting: Edge-Native LLM Drone Control

**Fully autonomous drone control running entirely on consumer hardware with zero cloud dependencies.**

Built upon the [TypeFly](https://github.com/anyscale/typefly) architecture and the minispec langauge invented by Typefly, Arial-Piloting eliminates cloud dependencies while enhancing autonomous capabilities through a multi-model architecture. The system coordinates five specialized AI models to achieve autonomous flight planning, real-time replanning, and complex task execution on laptops with 8GB VRAM.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Edge-Native Operation**: Complete elimination of cloud dependencies
- **Multi-Model Architecture**: 5 specialized AI models working in coordination
- **Autonomous Replanning**: Real-time task assessment and adaptation
- **Consumer Hardware**: Runs on standard laptops (8GB VRAM minimum)
- **Advanced Capabilities**: Person following, conditional logic, complex scene understanding

## 🎥 Demonstrations

- **Person Following**: 30-60 second continuous tracking in windy conditions
- **Complex Conditional Tasks**: "If you can see more than one chair behind you, then turn and go to the one with books on it"
- **Multi-Step Operations**: "Find something for me to eat. If you can, go for it and return. Otherwise, find something drinkable"
